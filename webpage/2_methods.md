In this section, we explore sound synthesis and manipulation methods strongly based on the FrFT. While we believe much more can be done, we have chosen to keep this simple, as our aim is to consolidate the foundations of the creative use of the FrFT in audio.

The FrFT can transform any type of sound, and while it might generate interesting sounds, such a transform is extremely complex. Consequently, it would be challenging to feel in control when using it broadly. This problem, however, diminishes when the input sound is fixed to one whose spectrogram is fully understood. By doing so, and recalling the spectrogram rotation property of the FrFT, one can anticipate the results generated by the transform and gain some control over it.
</p>

<p>
Based on this, we introduce the \(\alpha\)-Synthesis method as the application of the FrFT, with the previously mentioned limitations, on pure sinusoids. Sinusoids are clear examples of sounds with simple spectrograms that are easy to understand, allowing the use of the FrFT to generate complex yet intelligible sounds.

It is well known that the Fourier Transform can be used to create filters in the frequency domain through simple multiplication. Additionally, the Convolution Theorem allows this concept to be translated to the time domain via convolutions. This property led to the development of Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters, which can be designed to be quite accurate and, in some cases, computed more efficiently. Unfortunately, there is no known analog to the Convolution Theorem for the FrFT, so filtering a signal using this transform necessitates pure multiplication.

Given this, what exactly is filtering using the FrFT? The human auditory system has a well-studied sensitivity to frequency, making frequency domain filters a reasonable and understandable process in audio contexts. On the other hand, the FrFT transforms signals into the \(\alpha\)-domain, a mixture of frequency and time. To our knowledge, the human auditory system does not have a well-established understanding of this domain. Specifically, in the frequency domain, each band corresponds to a pure sinusoid in the time domain. However, a band in the \(\alpha\)-domain corresponds to a signal that heavily depends on the value of \(\alpha\), and to our understanding, no studies have explored human perception of such signals.
</p>

<p>
For our purposes, we propose the \(\alpha\)-Filtering method as a natural generalization of frequency domain filtering. Specifically, a signal is first transformed into the \(\alpha\)-domain using the FrFT, then multiplied with a kernel, and finally transformed back to the time domain using the corresponding inverse FrFT. Similar to the frequency domain, one can define \(\alpha\)-low pass, \(\alpha\)-band pass, and \(\alpha\)-high pass filters using appropriate kernels. However, it must be understood that "low," "band," and "high" in this context will generally not correspond to frequency. For example, an \(\alpha\)-low pass filtered signal might have richer high-frequency content than its \(\alpha\)-high pass counterpart.
